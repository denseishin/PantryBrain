# PantryBrain
This is a part of my broader smart pantry project Rik≈çtodana. This is currently in the prototype stage.
It provides the services that manage the inventory based on the signals that come from the associated sensors (PantrySense).
It also provides a REST-API for the smartphone app (PantryControl).

To get started, you need to rename the `smrtfood-example.db` in the `db` folder to `smrtfood.db`.
Then you need to run both `run_statemach.py` and `run_webservice.py` in the background (for example with the GNU tool `screen`).
Since this project relies on an MQTT broker, you need to set one up and change the credentials and broker address in `core/statemachine_mqtt.json`.

`fetch_recalls.py` needs to be executed every night. On Linux, you can do that with the `crontab` tool.
An example crontab entry that runs it every night at 4 a.m.:  
`0 4 * * *       /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/software/fetch_recalls.py`

### Security warning
Since this is still a prototype, many security measures are missing! Transport encryption for both the REST-API and the MQTT messages have not been implemented yet. Authentication and authorization techniques for the REST-API are also not implemented. TL;DR: This is a prototype without any security (yet).
